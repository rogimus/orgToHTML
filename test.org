#+BEGIN_theorem Problem 1

Let \(E=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha,i)\) where \(\alpha\) is the real fourth
root of 2 and \(i^2=-1\).
1. Prove that \([E:\mathbb{Q}]=8\).
2. Prove that \(E\) is a splitting field for \(x^4-2\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
3. Prove that there is a \(\mathbb{Q}-\) isomorphism \(\phi:\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\to \mathbb{Q}(i\alpha)\).

#+BEGIN_proof Proof of 1 
Firstly \(\alpha\) has minimal polynomial \(x^4-2\).
Viewing \(\mathbb{Q}\) as a subfield of \(\mathbb{C}\) 
we see that \(x^4-2\) splits as 
\[(x-\alpha)(x-e^{i\pi/2}\alpha)(x-e^{i\pi}\alpha)(x-e^{3i\pi/2}\alpha)\]
Since all of these linear terms are complex, \(x^4-2\) is irreducible 
over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
Since it has degree 4 we have 
\([\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]=4\).

Similarly we can show \(x^2+1\) is irreducible over 
\(\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) so \([\mathbb{Q}(\alpha,i):\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)]=2\).

By the multiplicativity of the degree of field extensions
we have 
\[ [E:\mathbb{Q}] = [E:\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)][\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}] =2\times 4 = 8 \]
